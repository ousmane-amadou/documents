% Section 0: Introduction, Background and Thesis
As of December 2017 no proposed theories of knowledge have managed
to specifiy knowledge conditions that are immune to the problem of
epistemic luck. % SOURCE: online
The most common approach of specifiying conditions for someones knowing
a proposition, is to provide an account of knowledge that is a modification
of the \textbf{Classical Analysis of Knowledge}:
\begin{displayquote} % SOURCE: Gettier is knowledge JTB
   S knows that P if and only if \\
  (i) P is true. \\
  (ii) S beleives that P, and \\
  (iii) S is justified in beleiving that P.
\end{displayquote} so that each condition is necessary for knowledge, and jointly
sufficent for knowledge. However, many philosophers also beleive that justification
is not required for knowledge. Epistemic Luck is a generic term ascribed to instances of
knowledge, where a belief in a proposition P is true merely by luck. In other words,
epistemic luck can be used to describe any number of ways in which it can be
accidental, coincidental, or fortuitous that a person has a true belief. To understand
why epistemic luck has proved to be a hard problem in epistemology, consider
the following example(s) of knowledge claims that suffer from epistemic luck:

\begin{displayquote}
\textbf{Example 1.}
\end{displayquote}
The focus of this paper is to compare and contrast the strengths of the process
reliabist and truth tracking theories of knowledge when it comes to solving the
problem of epistemic luck. I will argue that the Truth Tracking theory should be
preffered over the Truth Tracking Theory as a general solution to epistemic luck.

%%% Section 1: Formulating The Prefer Relation
To begin I will first give a provisional defintion of what it could mean to
prefer the Truth Tracking Theory over Process Reliabilism as a general solution to
epistemic luck. For two theories of knowldge $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$, consider the
following formulation preferedness:
\begin{displayquote}
    \textbf{Defintion 1.} As a general solution to Epistemic Luck,
    \textit{$T_{1}$ should be prefferred over $T_{2}$ as a general solution
    to epistemic luck} if and only if at least two of the following conditions are met:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[(i)] $T_{1}$ is a more tenable account of knowledge than $T_{2}$.
        \item[(ii)] $T_{1}$ resolves a larger number of epistemic luck knowledge claims than $T_{2}$.
        \item[(iii)] $T_{1}$ offers the favorable basis for further investigation of epistemic luck.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{displayquote}
  There may be other combinations of conditions that could accurrately capture
what it means to prefer Truth Tracking over Process Reliabilism as a general
solution to epistemic luck. In fact, I am not claiming that the conditions
specified give the most accurate definition preferedness. However, I do think
this defintion suffices as a basis for compxaring these two theories because
the most important aspects of these theories are being accounted for and weighted
equally. With this definition place let's move on to the first premise.
%%% Section 2: Premise 1 | Argument for Process Reliabilisms Tenability
% Part 1: Introduce Premise

% Part 2(a): Rejection of Closure Principle hurts TT's tenability
According to \textbf{Robert Nozick's Truth Tracking Theory}:
\begin{displayquote}
  \textit{S knows that P} if and only if
  \begin{enumerate}
      \item[(i)] P is true.
      \item[(ii)] S beleives that P.
      \item[(iii)] If P were false, S would not beleive that P.
      \item[(iv)] If P were true, S would beleive that P.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{displayquote}

whereas \textbf{Process Reliabilism} asserts that:
\begin{displayquote}
  \textit{S knows that P} if and only if
  \begin{enumerate}
      \item[(i)] P is true.
      \item[(ii)] S beleives that P.
      \item[(iii)] S is justified in beleiving that P.
      \item[(iv)] S is only justified in beleiving that P, if that beleif
      was formed using a reliable beleif forming process.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{displayquote}

One of the biggest criticsms of the Truth-Tracking theory is that it requires
the rejection of the highly intuitive closure principle. That is, according
to the truth tracking theory if S knows P and S  knows that  P $\Rightarrow$ Q,
then S does not necessarily know that Q. Nozick, however, claims that rejecting
the closure princple is actually a feature of the theory as a response to this
critism. He maintains that the fact the truth tracking theory illumaniting a
certain property of knowledge. Indeed, there is no substantial evidence that would
prove other wise. Even after considering that, it is still more plausible
to prefer a theory that coheres with our logical beleif system. Abonding the
closure princple hurts the Truth Tracking's theories tenablity. Therefore
Process Reliabilism is the more tenable theory.

% Part 3(a): The Truth Tracking theory is too vague
%% Subjunctive Conditional, Possible Worlds (What counts as a possible world)

% Part 3(b): Response to 3(a) | Process Reliabilism is vague as well!
Process Reliabilism is not without it's issues either.
Firstly, what is meant by process?
Secondly, the generality problem?
%%% Section 3: Premise 2 | Argument for Truth Trackings Resolution Count

%%% Section 4: Premise 3 | Argument for Favorable Basis
An advantage of Process Reliabilism is that it is a theory of both
justification and knowledge. If correct, Process Reliabilism would
allow us to understand how knowledge is contstructed and would
offer a basis for analyzing epistemic luck itself. % Justify this

However, it is still debated whether knowledge actually requires justification.
If it were the case that knowledge did require justification, Process Reliabilism
would be valuable. However, if it doesn't Process Reliabilism doesn't offer much
value since it is fundamentally flawed in assuming knowledge require justification.
A response to this could reject the Process Relibilist theory of justification
In Goldmans What is JTB, we learn that a reliable beleif forming Process
is neither sufficient nor necessary for knowledge.
