% Section 0: Introduction, Background and Thesis
As of December 2017 no proposed theories of knowledge have managed
to specifiy knowledge conditions that are immune to the problem of
epistemic luck. % SOURCE: online
The most common approach of specifiying conditions for someones knowing
a proposition, is to modify the \textbf{Classical Analysis of Knowledge}:
\begin{displayquote} % SOURCE: Gettier is knowledge JTB
   S knows that P if and only if \\
  (i) P is true. \\
  (ii) S beleives that P, and \\
  (iii) S is justified in beleiving that P.
\end{displayquote} so that each condition is necessary for knowledge, and jointly
sufficent for knowledge. However, many philosophers also beleive that justification
is not required for knowledge. Epistemic Luck is a generic term ascribed to instances of
knowledge, where a belief in a proposition P is true merely by luck. In other words,
epistemic luck that can be used to describe any number of ways in which it can be
accidental, coincidental, or fortuitous that a person has a true belief. To understand why epistemic luck has
proved to be a hard problem in epistemology, consider the following example(s) of knowledge claims
that suffer from epistemic luck:

\begin{displayquote}
\textbf{Example 1.}
\end{displayquote}
The focus of this paper is to compare and contrast the strengths of the process reliabist and
truth tracking theories of knowledge when it comes to solving the problem
of epistemic luck. I will argue that, if justification is required for
knowledge then Process Reliabilism should be preffered over the Truth Tracking
Theory as a general solution to epistemic luck.

%%% Section 1: Formulating The Prefer Relation
To begin I will first give a provisional formulation of what it could mean to
prfer Process Reliabilism over the Truth Tracking Theory as a general solution to epistemic luck.
For two theories of knowldge $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$, consider the following
formulation preferedness:
\begin{displayquote}
    \textbf{Defintion 1.} As a general solution to Epistemic Luck,
    \textit{$T_{1}$ should be prefferred over $T_{2}$ as a general solution
    to epistemic luck} if and only if at least two of the following conditions are met:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[(i)] $T_{1}$ is a more tenable account of knowledge than $T_{2}$.
        \item[(ii)] $T_{1}$ resolves a larger number of epistemic luck knowledge claims than $T_{2}$.
        \item[(iii)] $T_{1}$ offers the favorable basis for further investigation of epistemic luck.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{displayquote}

%%% Section 2: Premise 1 | Argument for Process Reliabilisms Tenability
% Part 1: Introduce Premise

% Part 2(a): Rejection of Closure Principle hurts TT's tenability
One of the biggest criticsms of the Truth-Tracking theory is that it requires
the rejection of the highly intuitive closure principle. That is according
to the truth tracking theory if S knows P and P implies Q S does not necessarily know Q.
% Part 2(b): Response to 2(a) | Closure is a feature, and so useful
Abonding a closure princple, may be a feature according to Nozick.

% Part 3(a): The Truth Tracking theory is too vague
%% Subjunctive Conditional, Possible Worlds (What counts as a possible world)

% Part 3(b): Response to 3(a) | Process Reliabilism is vague as well!
Process Reliabilism is not without it's issues either.
Firstly, what is meant by process?
Secondly, the generality problem?
%%% Section 3: Premise 2 | Argument for Truth Trackings Resolution Count

%%% Section 4: Premise 3 | Argument for Favorable Basis
An advantage of Process Reliabilism is that it is a theory of both
justification and knowledge. If correct, Process Reliabilism would
allow us to understand how knowledge is contstructed and would
offer a basis for analyzing epistemic luck itself. % Justify this

However, it is still debated whether knowledge actually requires justification.
If it were the case that knowledge did require justification, Process Reliabilism
would be valuable. However, if it doesn't Process Reliabilism doesn't offer much
value since it is fundamentally flawed in assuming knowledge require justification.

A response to this could reject the Process Relibilist theory of justification
In Goldmans What is JTB, we learn that a reliable beleif forming Process
is neither sufficient nor necessary for knowledge.
